## Overview

This project was initiated for Coding Fest 2023 by [Udit
Samant](https://github.com/goodgameruler), [Jennifer
Tan](https://github.com/jennifermtan), [Devanshi
Mirchandani](https://github.com/devanshimirchandani), and [Parth
Bhargava](https://github.com/gitparth12). The purpose of UniTrack is to present
a university services platform with a better user experience, mainly targeting
degree planning, unit selection, and time table selection.

After two iterations of technical stacks for this project we have settled on React, Next.Js, and Vercel

We welcome any collaboration and contributions from the public to this project, please refer to the [open source contribution](#open-source) section.

_We would like to acknowledge Antriksh Dhand in his contribution as the original ideator of this project_

## Contributing

Read the guidelines below to write good commit messages, branch names, and make pull requests that follow the conventions we will be using throughout the project.

### Issues
We welcome contribution to this project. Changes to this repository will be received on a issue assigned basis. To contribute...

- [ ] Find an issue that is unassigned, unmarked, or contains the help wanted label.
- [ ] Change code and create a pull request closing the issue - see [link](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue). After which a maintainer will assign you to the issue (If this issue is large in complexity and you want to be assigned to the issue, comment on the issue).

### Commit Messages

- Capitalise the subject line.
- Do not end with a period.
- Use imperative mood, i.e. instead of *"Added ..."* write *"Add ..."*.
- Keep messages logical and relevant, do not write things like *"Please work"* or *"I hate frontend"*. To help decide the extent of this, imagine trying to access a point in the project 2 weeks ago, it would be better to have something like *"Add CSS for Navbar template"* or , so that we know from a glance what the commit is for.
- For more detailed messages, use `git commit -m <title> -m <description>`, however short and concise is still preferred.

### Branch Names
Make a branch using `git checkout -b <branch_name>`.
- Names fall under one of **4** categories
	- Minor Feature: `minor-featureName`
	- Major Feature: `major-featureName`
	- Patch: `patch-patchName`
	- Miscellaneous: `name`
		- For example `documentation` for changing the README, or adding another markdown

_patch: a non API breaking change to the codebase - anyone that uses your code will not need to be concerned with the changes you pushed._
_minor: a minor API change to the codebase - anyone that uses your code will need to slightly modify implementation of their code._
_major: a major API change to the codebase - generally breaks code, wherever used, and will need significant modification._

Examples
- Adding comments - patch
- Image sizing changes (doesn't effect other code) - patch
- Changing div css - minor
- Changing div ordering - minor
- Changing server API endpoints - major as it breaks other code.

### Pull Requests
*Summarised from [this article](https://namingconvention.org/git/pull-request-naming.html).*

#### Title
- Short and descriptive summary
- Start with corresponding ticket/story id (e.g. from Jira, GitHub issue)
- Should be capitalized and written in imperative present tense
- Do not end with period
- Suggested format: *#<Ticket_ID> PR description*

#### Description
- Closing keyword with issue number - see [link](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) (e.g. Closes #0).
- Separated with a blank line from the subject
- Explain changes and justify
- Separate different issues into different paragraphs (capitalising each paragraph)
- We recommend using screenshots over long descriptions (A simple before and after will do)
- If the description is longer than a paragraph include a `TLDR:` one-liner as the first line

#### Example Pull Request
```
TLDR: (Necessary for longer PRs) this PR defines PR message syntax.
resolves/closes/fixes #ISSUE_NO (, resolves/closes/fixes #ISSUE_NO2 (, ...))

This pull request is part of the work to make it easier for people to contribute to naming convention guides.

To achieve this, we have:
- Found an issue
- Made a PR
- Made clear the changes introduced
- Included images
```
