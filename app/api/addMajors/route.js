The advanced unit covers the same overall concepts as PHYS3034 but with a greater level of challenge and academic rigour, largely in separate lectures. You will study techniques of quantum mechanics to predict the energy-level structure of electrons in atoms, introducing techniques useful in the broad field of quantum physics, with applications e. g. in atomic clocks. You will study the theoretical foundation of statistical mechanics, including both classical and quantum distributions. You will apply a variety of numerical schemes for solving ordinary and partial differential equations, learn about the suitability of particular methods to particular problems, and their accuracy and stability. The module includes computational lab sessions, in which you will actively solve a range of physics problems.

We will then study soft tissue mechanics, with respect to both non-linear and viscoelastic descriptions, with a significant focus on the mathematical methods used in relation to the mechanics of the system. We will then look at specific aspects of biomechanics: muscle mechanics, joint mechanics, kinematics and dynamics of human gait (gait analysis), biomechanics of cells, physiological fluid flow, biomechanics of injury, functional and mechanical response of tissues to mechanical loading. Biomaterials This course will involve the study of biomaterials from two perspectives: firstly, the response of the body towards the biomaterial - an immune response and foreign body reaction; secondly, the response of the biomaterial to the body - corrosion, biodegradation, and mechanical failure. Our study will begin with the response of the body towards the biomaterial. We will begin by looking at the immune system itself and then move on to look at the normal inflammatory response. We will then study in detail the foreign body reaction caused by biomaterials. The final part of this section is the study of protein adsorption onto biomaterials, with a strong focus on the Vroman effect. Then we will move onto the response of the biomaterial to the body. We will begin by a review of biomaterials, their applications, and compositions, and mechanical properties.

The course does not prepare a student for immediate, unsupervised participation in construction and design work associated with the topics covered. The topics may vary dependent on current and planned projects in Sydney, NSW and Australia. At this stage the topics are hard rock tunnelling and general hard rock underground excavation; soft ground tunnelling; underground construction; micro tunnelling; cut and cover (cover and cut) tunnelling; earth retaining systems; piling; formwork and falsework (incl Tilt up, Ultrafloor, Sacrificial form); dewatering; pavement design and construction - rigid and flexible (incl and pavement construction materials); stormwater drainage design and construction; marine construction; civil construction in environmentally sensitive areas; contract a', 'Engineering Design and Construction', 'https://sydney.edu.au/students/units/unit.CIVL8811.html');`,
